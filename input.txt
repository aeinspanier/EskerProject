Trek Bicycle is a privately owned corporation headquartered in Waterloo, Wisconsin. As the largest bicycle company in
the United States, Trek has 16 international distribution centers and 5,000 independent bicycle dealers around the world.
Not bad for a company that started back in 1976 in a barn with just five people. However, if there’s one downside to global
business success, it’s this: Managing important business processes — in Trek’s case, collecting payments — is often
costly, complex and unsustainable.
